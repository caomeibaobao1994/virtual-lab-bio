Your team previous decided to modify existing nanobodies to improve their binding to the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Now you must use ESM to suggest modifications to an existing antibody. Please write a complete Python script that takes a nanobody sequence as input and uses ESM amino acid log-likelihoods to identify the most promising point mutations by log-likelihood ratio.\n\nHere are the agenda rules that must be followed:\n\n1. Your code must be self-contained (with appropriate imports) and complete.\n\n2. Your code may not include any undefined or unimplemented variables or functions.\n\n3. Your code may not include any pseudocode; it must be fully functioning code.\n\n4. Your code may not include any hard-coded examples.\n\n5. If your code needs user-provided values, write code to parse those values from the command line.\n\n6. Your code must be high quality, well-engineered, efficient, and well-documented (including docstrings, comments, and Python type hints if using Python).\n\nMachine Learning Specialist, please provide your response to the agenda."

        "agent": "Scientific Critic",
        "message": "### Critique of Machine Learning Specialist's Answer:\n\n#### Adherence to Agenda:\n1. **Self-contained Code**: The provided script is self-contained with appropriate imports and appears to be complete.\n2. **No Undefined Variables or Functions**: The script does not include any undefined or unimplemented variables or functions.\n3. **No Pseudocode**: The code is fully functioning without any pseudocode.\n4. **No Hard-coded Examples**: The script does not include hard-coded examples and relies on user-provided input.\n5. **Command Line Parsing**: The script correctly parses user-provided values from the command line.\n6. **Code Quality**: The code is well-documented, efficient, and uses type hints.\n\n#### Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Error Handling**:\n   - The script lacks error handling for potential issues such as invalid amino acid sequences, empty input, or issues with model loading. Adding basic error handling would make the script more robust.\n\n2. **Model Selection Flexibility**:\n   - The script hard-codes the model name (`esm1b_t33_650M_UR50S`). Allowing the user to specify the model via command-line arguments would provide more flexibility.\n\n3. **Performance Considerations**:\n   - The script computes log-likelihood ratios for all possible mutations, which can be computationally expensive for longer sequences. Implementing a threshold for log-likelihood ratios or limiting the number of suggested mutations could improve performance.\n\n4. **Output Formatting**:\n   - The output is printed in a basic format. Providing a more structured output, such as a CSV file, would be more useful for further analysis.\n\n5. **Documentation and Comments**:\n   - While the script is well-documented, adding more detailed comments explaining the rationale behind certain steps (e.g., why layer 33 is chosen for logits) would enhance understanding.\n\n6. **Device Management**:\n   - The script checks for GPU availability but does not allow the user to override this choice. Adding a command-line argument to force CPU usage could be beneficial for users with limited GPU resources.\n\n#### Specific Suggestions:\n\n1. **Add Error Handling**:\n   ```python\n   if not all(aa in alphabet.tok_to_idx for aa in sequence):\n       raise ValueError(\"Invalid amino acid in sequence.\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Model Selection via Command Line**:\n   ```python\n   parser.add_argument(\"--model_name\", type=str, default=\"esm1b_t33_650M_UR50S\", help=\"Name of the ESM model to use.\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Performance Optimization**:\n   - Add a threshold for log-likelihood ratios:\n     ```python\n     threshold = 1.0  # Example threshold\n     mutations = [mut for mut in mutations if mut[3] > threshold]\n     ```\n\n4. **Structured Output**:\n   - Save results to a CSV file:\n     ```python\n     import csv\n     with open('mutations.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:\n         writer = csv.writer(file)\n         writer.writerow([\"Original AA\", \"Position\", \"Mutated AA\", \"Log-Likelihood Ratio\"])\n         writer.writerows(mutations)\n     ```\n\n5. **Detailed Comments**:\n   - Add comments explaining the choice of layers and other critical decisions.\n\n6. **Device Management**:\n   ```python\n   parser.add_argument(\"--device\", type=str, default=None, help=\"Force device usage (cpu or cuda).\")\n   device = args.device if args.device else (\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n   ```\n\n#### Validation of Adherence:\n- The script adheres to the agenda rules, but the lack of error handling and flexibility in model selection are areas that could be improved to better meet the agenda's requirements for high-quality and well-engineered code.\n\n### Corrective Feedback:\n- **Error Handling**: Implement basic error checking for input validation.\n- **Model Selection**: Allow users to specify the ESM model via command-line arguments.\n- **Performance**: Consider adding a threshold or limit to the number of suggested mutations to improve efficiency.\n- **Output**: Provide a more structured output format for easier analysis.\n- **Documentation**: Enhance comments to explain critical decisions in the code.\n- **Device Management**: Allow users to override device selection.\n\nBy addressing these points, the script will not only adhere more strictly to the agenda but also be more robust, flexible, and user-friendly."

        "message": "### Critique of Machine Learning Specialist's Most Recent Answer:\n\n#### Adherence to Agenda:\n1. **Self-contained Code**: The script remains self-contained with all necessary imports and is complete.\n2. **No Undefined Variables or Functions**: The script avoids undefined or unimplemented variables or functions.\n3. **No Pseudocode**: The code is fully functioning without any pseudocode.\n4. **No Hard-coded Examples**: The script relies on user-provided input and avoids hard-coded examples.\n5. **Command Line Parsing**: The script includes comprehensive command-line arguments for flexibility.\n6. **Code Quality**: The code quality is high with improved documentation, error handling, and user-friendly features.\n\n#### Areas for Further Improvement:\n\n1. **Error Handling**:\n   - While the script now checks for empty input and handles model loading errors, it could benefit from more granular error messages and handling specific exceptions (e.g., handling invalid device specifications).\n\n2. **Model Loading Fallback**:\n   - The fallback mechanism for model loading is a good addition, but it could be enhanced by providing a list of available models or attempting to load a default model if the specified one fails.\n\n3. **Performance Considerations**:\n   - The option to limit the number of suggested mutations is useful, but the script could also include a progress indicator or logging for long-running tasks, especially when processing large sequences.\n\n4. **Output Formatting**:\n   - The verbosity control is a good addition, but the script could also provide more structured logging (e.g., using Python's `logging` module) for better traceability and debugging.\n\n5. **Documentation and Comments**:\n   - The comments have improved, but some sections could still benefit from more detailed explanations, particularly around the choice of hyperparameters and model layers.\n\n6. **Device Management**:\n   - The device management is more robust now, but it could include checks for the availability of specific GPU devices (e.g., checking if a specified GPU ID is available).\n\n#### Specific Suggestions:\n\n1. **Granular Error Handling**:\n   - Provide more specific error messages and handle specific exceptions:\n     ```python\n     if not sequence:\n         raise ValueError(\"Input sequence is empty. Please provide a valid amino acid sequence.\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Enhanced Model Loading Fallback**:\n   - Attempt to load a default model or provide a list of available models:\n     ```python\n     try:\n         model, alphabet = load_esm_model(model_name)\n     except Exception as e:\n         print(f\"Error loading model '{model_name}': {e}\")\n         default_model_name = \"esm1b_t33_650M_UR50S\"\n         print(f\"Attempting to load default model '{default_model_name}'.\")\n         model, alphabet = load_esm_model(default_model_name)\n     ```\n\n3. **Progress Indicator**:\n   - Add a progress indicator for long-running tasks:\n     ```python\n     from tqdm import tqdm\n     for i in tqdm(range(len(sequence))):\n         # Mutation suggestion logic\n     ```\n\n4. **Structured Logging**:\n   - Use Python's `logging` module for better logging:\n     ```python\n     import logging\n     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n     logger.info(\"Starting mutation suggestion process.\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Detailed Documentation**:\n   - Add more detailed explanations for hyperparameter choices:\n     ```python\n     # Threshold of 1.0 is chosen based on empirical observations to filter out less significant mutations.\n     ```\n\n6. **Specific GPU Device Checks**:\n   - Check if a specified GPU ID is available:\n     ```python\n     if args.device.startswith('cuda:'):\n         gpu_id = int(args.device.split(':')[1])\n         if gpu_id >= torch.cuda.device_count():\n             raise ValueError(f\"Specified GPU ID {gpu_id} is not available. Available GPUs: {torch.cuda.device_count()}\")\n     ```\n\n#### Validation of Adherence:\n- The script adheres to the agenda rules more robustly with the added improvements. However, there are still areas where further enhancements could make the script more resilient and user-friendly.\n\n### Corrective Feedback:\n- **Error Handling**: Implement more granular error messages and handle specific exceptions.\n- **Model Loading**: Enhance the fallback mechanism by providing a list of available models or attempting to load a default model.\n- **Performance**: Include a progress indicator or logging for long-running tasks.\n- **Output**: Provide more structured logging for better traceability.\n- **Documentation**: Enhance comments to explain hyperparameter choices more thoroughly.\n- **Device Management**: Include checks for the availability of specific GPU devices.\n\nBy addressing these points, the script will not only adhere more strictly to the agenda but also be more robust, flexible, and user-friendly, ensuring it meets the high standards required for scientific research."
